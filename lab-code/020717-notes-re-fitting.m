%output struct has lots of good info

getThreshold
%can return threshold based on either scaled or not scaled fits -- use
%scaled for sure. 3rd input arg == 0.
%default fit from output of psignifit is unscaled: so either find in
%Options or run again with scaled.

%convert fitted values to dprime 


%% NEUROMETRIC


% formula instead of classifier to fit neural FR data


% get Chronux again
