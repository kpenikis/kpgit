% X: Make population matrix of binned spikecounts --  time(bin) x units 

% for Y = each bin vector 
% calculate malanobis distance of each bin observation from the rest
% d2 = mahal(Y,X)

% What does the distribution of d2 values?
% Pull the larger d2 values and ask what the stimulus was at that time
